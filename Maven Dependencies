*** Maven Dependencies ***

* There are two types
  1. Direct Dependency
      - These are dependency defined in your pom.xml file under the <dependency/> section.
      - Direct dependencies are the ones that we explicitly include in the project.
      
      Ex. 
      <dependency>
         <groupId>junit</groupId>
         <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
         <version>4.12</version>
      </dependency>
      
   2. Transitive Dependency
       - Transitive dependencies are required by direct dependencies. Maven automatically includes required transitive dependencies in our project.
       
 *** Maven supports both dependecnies.
