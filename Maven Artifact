*** What Is a Maven Artifact? ***

- An artifact is an element that a project can either use or produce. In Maven terminology, an artifact is an output generated after a Maven project build. 
- It can be, for example, a jar, war, or any other executable file.
- Also, Maven artifacts include five key elements, groupId, artifactId, version, packaging, and classifier. 

*** There are two types

    1. Release Artifact
       - A release artifact indicates that the version is stable and can be used outside development processes like integration tests, 
         customer qualification, pre-production.
       - Release artifact is unique and thats for end users.
       - Resease version build from main branch.
       
    2. Snapshot Artifact
       - A snapshot artifact indicates that the project is under development. When we install or publish a component, Maven checks the version attribute. 
         If it contains the string “SNAPSHOT”, Maven converts this key into a date and time value in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) format.
 
 ** The artifact produced by maven have form <artifactId>-<version><extension>.
     
     Example:
     
      Release Artifact:  Webapp-2.21.jar
      
      Snapshot Artifact: Webapp-2.21-SNAPSHOT.jar After build, 
                         Webapp-2.21-SNAPSHOT-20221214.060915.jar
