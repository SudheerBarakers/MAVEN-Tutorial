*** Maven Repository ***

A maven repository is a directory of packaged JAR file with pom.xml file. Maven searches for dependencies in the repositories.

*** There are 3 types of maven repository:

1. Local Repository   - Maven local repository is located in your local system. It is created by the maven when you run any maven command.
2. Central Repository - Maven central repository is located on the web. It has been created by the apache maven community itself. https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/
3. Remote Repository  - Maven remote repository is located on the web. Most of libraries can be missing from the central repository such as JBoss library etc, 
                        so we need to define remote repository in pom.xml file.

Maven searches for the dependencies in the following order:

        Local repository then Central repository then Remote repository
